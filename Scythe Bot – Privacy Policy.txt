Scythe Bot – Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information Scythe Bot (“the Bot”) collects, how it is used, and how it is stored.
By using the Bot, you agree to this policy. If you do not agree, remove the Bot from your server.

2. Information the Bot Collects

The Bot only collects information required for core features to operate.
This includes:

a) Discord User Information

User IDs

Usernames and discriminators (e.g., User#1234)

Roles (for ticket staff permissions or verification)

b) Guild (Server) Information

Guild IDs

Channel IDs (ticket logs, verification logs, VC settings)

Role IDs (verified role, staff roles)

c) Feature-Specific Data

Ticket System:
Temporary storage of ticket form responses, message content, and transcripts.

Temporary Voice Channels:
VC ownership, co-owner lists, VC bans, and rename/lock settings.

Verification System:
Account age check results and verification logs.

3. Information the Bot Does NOT Collect

Scythe Bot does NOT collect or store:

Email addresses

Passwords

IP addresses

Payment information

Private messages (DMs)

Any content outside of configured bot channels

The Bot only operates within Discord and only sees data Discord provides to all bots.

4. How the Information Is Used

The Bot uses collected information only to:

Create and manage temporary voice channels

Provide ticket support and generate transcripts

Verify members and assign roles

Log relevant actions to configured channels

Maintain persistent user blocklists for VC control

The Bot does not sell, share, or transfer data to third parties.

5. Data Storage Duration
Temporary Voice Data

VC ownership, bans, and co-owner data are stored only while the VC exists.

When the VC is deleted, this data is also removed.

Ticket Data

Transcript text is stored only in your configured transcript channel until you delete it.

The Bot does not store transcripts anywhere else.

Verification Logs

Stored only in the Discord verification log channel you configured.

Configuration Data

Server settings (roles, channels, VC settings) are kept until changed or reset with /config.

6. Data Removal

Users may request removal of their personal data from:

VC blocklists

Ticket logs (by contacting a server admin)

Verification logs (via server admins only)

Removing the Bot from a server immediately stops all data collection.

7. Security

No data leaves Discord’s platform or your server.

The Bot stores configuration files locally on the owner’s secure VPS.

Only the Bot owner has access to server-level files.

No user or staff member can access raw data storage.

8. Children’s Privacy

Scythe Bot does not knowingly store or target personal data from children under 13.
(Discord itself requires users to be 13+.)

9. Third-Party Access

The Bot does not share data with any external service.
All data remains inside Discord unless server staff choose to export logs.

10. Contact
